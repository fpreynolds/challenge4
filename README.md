VCBC Week 4 Challenge: Coding Quiz


<!-- TODO -->

set up nav bar with high scores link on left and timer 00 on right

set up start button with jquery, CODE QUIZ centered with big bright START button centered below it

when start button is pressed timer jumps to 60 and first question appears in place of start message

each question has an <H2> with the question itself. then there are four buttons with answers written on them. if the user clicks the right button the next question appears and a marker is appended to score array. if user selects wrong button time is reduced by 5 seconds. 

score array is initially empty but each correct answer will append a string to it. at the end of the quiz, or when the timer reaches 0, the player submits initials and their score is returned as the length of the array and their initials.

these scores can be accessed by clicking the high scores link in the nav bar




clicking start button will hide div1 and show div2, it will also start the timer.
when the timer ends or the player finishes the questions they'll get an ALERT that asks for initials, when the player clicks ok div2 will hide and div3 will show and list player highscores

have fun scripting this in like 4 hours jackass
